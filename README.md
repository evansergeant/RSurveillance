RSurveillance
=============

`RSurveillance` provides a range of functions for the design and
    analysis of disease surveillance activities. These functions were
    originally developed for animal health surveillance activities but can be
    equally applied to aquatic animal, wildlife, plant and human health
    surveillance activities. Utilities are included for sample size calculation
    and analysis of representative surveys for disease freedom, risk-based
    studies for disease freedom and for prevalence estimation.

You can track (and contribute to) development of `RSurveillance`
at https://github.com/evansergeant/RSurveillance.

Usage
-----
`RSurveillance` functions are organised into several broad areas of surveillance, namely:
* representative freedom surveys,
* freedom methods for imperfect tests and finite populations,
* risk-based freedom surveys,
* probability of freedom estimation,
* prevalence estimation,
* combined testing and
* pooled testing for freedom.

Within these areas functions can be further grouped according to purpose (depending on surveillance area/purpose), such as sample size calculation, population sensitivity estimation, prevalence estimation and background functions. Specific functions are summarised below according to these categories and additional information and examples are available in R using the `help()` and `example()` functions.
